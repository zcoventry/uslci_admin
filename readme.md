==========
This ReadMe file serves as the main landing page for the U.S. Life Cycle Inventory Database Management System (USLCI-MS).
The USLCI-MS is a system for managing the [U.S. Life Cycle Inventory Database][uslci] (USLCI).  At a basic level, the system is comprised of four repos, a [supporting wiki][wiki], and this ReadMe file.

![Simple USLCI-MS Architecture][simple]

The four repos are:
* [Archive Information Package][aip]
* [Management][mgmt]
* [Data Review][review]
* [USLCI Versions][versions]

Please refer to the [wiki][wiki] for more complete details on the [uslci_aip][aip] repo, the [uslci_review][review] repo, or the USLCI-MS in general.

The **uslci_mgmt** repo (i.e. this repo) is reserved for files relevant to the development and ongoing management of the USLCI.  Please see [uslci_mgmt file conventions][bad_link] for details on what files are accepted in this repository.
