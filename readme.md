Administration Repository
==========
Welcome to the Administration Repository (Admin Repo)!  This repo is part of the [USLCI-Management system][wiki] which supports the management and development of the [U.S. Life Cycle Inventory Database][uslci] (USLCI).  First time users are encouraged to read the [Quick Start Guide][qs_guide].

The Admin Repo is reserved for files relevant to the management and development of the USLCI-MS.  Files related to data published in the USLCI are excluded from this repo and, instead, should be placed in the [AIP Repo][aip].
